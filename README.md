# Deep-Learning-using-Keras

## Overview
This project performs image-based recognition with Deep Learning using Keras.This project involves transfer learning with the MobileNet V2 Model, and then training on the Dog Breed Identification dataset from Kaggle.  

## Files
- `CS 4372 Project 3.ipynb` — The Google Colab notebook containing the full analysis code.
- `README.md` — This README.
- `CS 4372 Project 3.pdf` - A PDF of a previous iteration of the Google Colab notebook run.

## Instructions
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click **File → Upload notebook** and select `CS 4372 Project 3.ipynb`.
4. Make sure you are connected to the GPU runtime.
5. Run all cells sequentially. All necessary libraries are already imported and installed within the notebook.

## Notes
- No additional setup is required.
- Data is fetched from a shared Google storage system

## WARNING: 
This project utilizes deep learning and takes approximately 1 hour to execute all iterations with different hyperparameters

Note: A PDF of a previous iteration of the code and outputs will be provided due to the lengthy execution time
